# TrialVR
TrialVR is an extension to the [Trial game engine](https://github.com/Shirakumo/trial) that handles input from and renders to a modern virtual reality headset, using OpenVR. It provides an Emacs-based REPL that allows one to code interactively and iteratively whilst in virtual reality. It runs on Windows and Linux, and requires a SteamVR installation.

## Usage
